GNU C++11  

Run `make` to compile all tasks.  
Or compile individual task providing path to the source code:  
```
make compile SRCPATH=./src/day_1_sonar_sweep/part_1.cpp
```  
Binaries would be stored alongside with source code with the `*.o` ext.  
When running a program, don't forget to provide path to input data, smth like this:  
```
./src/day_1_sonar_sweep/part_1.o ./src/day_1_sonar_sweep/input.txt
```  
or  
```
cd ./src/day_1_sonar_sweep
./part_1.o ./input.txt
```
